# Adding Comments: choose two of the programs you've
# written, and ad at least one comment to each. If
# you don't have anything specific to write because
# your programs are too simple at this point, just 
# add your name and the current date at the top of
# each program file. Then write one sentence 
# describing what the program does.

message1 = "Since all of the other programs in this \n"
message2 = "Chapter have comments, I will concatenate "
message3 = "four variables together to make one long, \n"
message4 = "very long sentence, which is too long."

print(message1 + message2)
print(message3 + message4)
