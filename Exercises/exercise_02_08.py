# Number Eight: write addition, subtraction, multiplication
# and division operations that each result in the number 8.
# Be sure to enclose your operations in print statements to
# see the results. You should create four lines that look
# like this:
#
#   print(5 + 3)
#
# Your output should simply be four lines with the number 8
# appearing once on each line.

print(5 + 3)
print(11 - 3)
print(2 * 4)
print(8 / 1)
