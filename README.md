# Python Crash Course - Chapter 2 Exercises and Solutions

This repository contains the Examples, Exercises, and Solutions
for Chapter 2 of Python Crash Course by Eric Matthes.

I created this repository for two reasons. First, I wanted to 
incorporate Git and GitHub into my workflow, so I could give
myself an opportunity to practice the technologies. Second, I
wanted to show my work. That is, I used C and Vim on a Fedora
37 system in a VirtualBox environment to create, use, and 
manage directories and files as I work through Matthes' Python
Crash Course book.

Please feel free to reach out to me if you have any questions
or comments. In addition, feel free to utilize the solutions
for your consumption and edification.
